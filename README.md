# Classifying Video Game Genres With Youtube
![Image](Youtube.png)

Idea: Youtube has a vast library of games which may need to be categorized for copyright reasons. This deep learning project would classify video games to help solve this issue. The range of categories can be simple. These categories include racing, first person shooter, sandbox, rpg, 

Dataset: [Youtube8M dataset](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/). This data set allows access to various amounts of access to videos and relative information. Youtube has also classified various categories which will allow me to get started quickly.

Programs: I will import the tensorflow library. I will use PyCharm as my IDE. 
Midterm goal: By this date, my algorithm should be able to parse through youtube videos and use neural networks to recognize one genre.

Final goal: By this date, my algorithm should be able to recognize multiple video game genres. 

I will not have any other partners.
