# Classifying Video Game Genres With Youtube
![Image](Youtube.png)

Idea: Youtube has a vast library of games which may need to be categorized for copyright reasons. This deep learning project would classify video games to help solve this issue. The range of categories can be simple. These categories include racing, first person shooter, sandbox, rpg, 

Dataset: [Youtube8M dataset](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/). This data set allows access to various amounts of access to videos and relative information. Youtube has also classified various categories which will allow me to get started quickly.

Programs: I will import the tensorflow library. I will use PyCharm as my IDE. 
Midterm goal: By this date, my algorithm should be able to parse through youtube videos and obtain images to recognize a genre. These images may be screenshots of videos, or video thumbnails. 

Papers to read: 
1. [Detecting Guns in Video Content](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/716.pdf)
2. [Google Cloud and YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/711.pdf)
3. [YouTube-8M Video Classification](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/705.pdf)

Final goal: By this date, my algorithm should be able to recognize multiple video game genres from thumbnails or screenshots from each video. 

I will not have any other partners.
